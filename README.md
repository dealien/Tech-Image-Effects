# Tech-Image-Effects
A collection of various image/video effects for use during technical theater. 

Some materials used in this project are not my own. These items are shown below, and include a link to the URL where I found the file in question (if known).

## Processing Scripts
For the Processing scripts, smaller images are better. Larger images can be resized using [this website](http://resizeimage.net/), or done locally via [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php).
